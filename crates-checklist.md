# Crates Release Checklist
1. Update the version number for the crates badge in `README.md`
2. Update version number in `Cargo.toml` as required for each of the crates: `omnipaxos`, `omnipaxos_macros`, `omnipaxos_storage`, and `omnipaxos_ui` 
3. Make sure that `./check.sh` passes
4. Run `cargo publish --dry-run` on each of the crates.

   3. `omnipaxos_storage`
   4. `omnipaxos_ui`
