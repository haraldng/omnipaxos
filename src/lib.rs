//! OmniPaxos is a library for implementing distributed replicated logs with strong consistency guarantees
//! that provides seamless reconfiguration while also being completely resilient to partial network partitions.
//! This library provides the distributed log abstraction as a black-box for the user, where the user only has to
//! provide its desired network and storage implementations.
//!
//! # Crate feature flags
//! The following crate feature flags are available. They are configured in your Cargo.toml.
//! * `batch_accept` - Batch multiple log entries into a single message to reduce overhead.
//! * `latest_accepted` - Only send latest accepted log index as all preceding entries are implicitly accepted. Reduces message overhead.
//! * `latest_decide` - Only send latest decided log index as all preceding entries are implicitly decided. Reduces message overhead.
//! * `continued_leader_reconfiguration` - Let the cluster pick the current leader as the initial leader in the new configuration (if possible) to shorten down-time during reconfiguration.
