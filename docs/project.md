## Bleeding Edge

This tutorial is built off the `master` branch on GitHub and thus tends to be a bit ahead of what is available in a release.
If you would like to try out new features before they are released, you can add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
omnipaxos_core = { git = "https://github.com/haraldng/omnipaxos", branch = "master" }
```
--->

### Documentation

If you need the API docs for the latest master run the following at an appropriate location (e.g., outside another local git repository):

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/haraldng/omnipaxos
cd omnipaxos
cargo doc --open --no-deps
```
