The playground is an interactive dashboard that interacts with a simple in-memory database replicated using OmniPaxos. From the dashboard, users can perform different operations and simulate network failures to see how OmniPaxos behaves. The different OmniPaxos servers in the playground also use the [dashboard feature](../../omnipaxos/dashboard) which users can attach to and see how servers can be monitored in practice.

The playground only requires docker and renders the dashboard in the terminal:
